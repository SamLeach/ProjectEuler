Project Euler C# Solutions

There are 4 implementations for each problem:

1. BruteForce
2. Linq
3. Optimised
4. ProjectEuler

Each implement ISolutions.

The solutions can be run from the test project. There is a test class for each of the 4 implementations.

Brute Force Solutions
=====================

Here are naive and brute force solutions. It is interesting to see how the algorithms change as they are optimised so I have kept the brute force versions here for comparison and learning.

Linq
====

The other solutions cannot leverage Linq. These solutions can use Linq.

Optimised
=========

These solutions are optimised. I tried to optimise as well as I could without cheating by getting help from the internet. If I look something up I will document it.

Project Euler
=============

These solutions are a C# implementation of the answers that Project Euler provides once you complete a problem. Used to compare with my own optimised solutions.
